For VMWare workstation a workaround is required to access console ports on e.g. Cisco IOSv and IOSXRv.
In VMWare workstation an optional serial port should be configured whilst the VM is off.
The serial port is configured as a named pipe with the drop down options 'From: Server --- To: An Appplication'.
THis should result in a socket being created at boot time, e.g. /tmp/tty.
Use 'socat' and 'telnet' to establish a console, i.e.
 $ socat  /tmp/tty tcp-listen:9999
and in another session
 $ telnet localhost 9999
For the initial password excahnge the CR/NL munging in telnet LINEMODE prevent a working login.
The solution I used is to set mode=character in telnet and be sure to use CTRL-J as the RETURN key.
For the IOSXRv images the default username/password is cisco/cisco.
The correct OS choice is not known - FreeBSD results in no network interfaces being detected for ISOXRv.
Note generally that the network interfaces are not known to be working under VMW ws 15.  The is a work-in-progress.
